To ensure that MediGuide communicates effectively and empathetically, we explore how different **prompting strategies** can optimize its responses across real-world scenarios.

---

### **Objective**
Demonstrate the application and benefits of five prompting techniques—**zero-shot**, **few-shot**, **chain-of-thought**, **role-based**, and **multi-modal**—in improving MediGuide’s performance across diverse healthcare support tasks.

## Output
## **Prompting Techniques & Use Cases**

### **1. Zero-Shot Prompting**
**Use Case:** Responding to an unexpected patient query.

**Prompt:**  
*"What should I eat for dinner if my blood sugar was high all day?"*

**MediGuide Response (Zero-shot):**  
"Since your blood sugar was high today, consider a low-carbohydrate dinner like grilled chicken with steamed vegetables. Avoid sugary drinks or starchy sides like bread or rice."

**Benefit:**  
Quick response without prior examples. Efficient for general knowledge questions or common advice.

---

### **2. Few-Shot Prompting**
**Use Case:** Providing tailored advice by learning from examples.

**Prompt:**  
*Example 1:  
Q: I forgot to take my morning blood pressure pill. What should I do?  
A: If you're within a few hours, you can still take it. Otherwise, skip it and continue your normal schedule tomorrow.*

*Example 2:  
Q: My knee pain is worse today. Should I still go for a walk?  
A: If the pain is sharp or swelling, it's best to rest. Gentle stretches can help, but avoid strain.*

*Now:  
Q: My sugar levels are okay, but I feel dizzy this afternoon. What could be the reason?"*

**MediGuide Response (Few-shot):**  
"Dizziness can be due to dehydration, fatigue, or blood sugar changes. Drink water, rest, and check your sugar again. If it continues, contact your doctor."

**Benefit:**  
Improves contextual understanding and response tone by mimicking past examples.

---

### **3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
**Use Case:** Handling complex health reasoning.

**Prompt:**  
*"Help the user decide if they should take insulin after eating a meal that caused a sugar spike."*

**MediGuide Response (Chain-of-Thought):**  
"First, let’s understand your situation. You had a high-sugar meal, and your blood sugar has spiked. Next, check how much it has spiked using your glucose monitor. If it's significantly above your usual range, consult your insulin adjustment plan or contact your doctor. If the spike is minor, hydration and light activity may help."

**Benefit:**  
Encourages step-by-step reasoning, improving clarity and accuracy in medical advice.

---

### **4. Role-Based Prompting**
**Use Case:** Providing comforting emotional support.

**Prompt:**  
*"You are a compassionate caregiver. The patient says: 'I feel lonely and tired all the time.' Respond."*

**MediGuide Response (Role-based):**  
"I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. You're not alone—many people feel this way when dealing with health issues. Would you like me to suggest relaxing activities or breathing exercises to help you feel better? I'm here for you."

**Benefit:**  
Enhances empathy and emotional intelligence in patient interaction, critical for elder care.

---

### **5. Multi-Modal Prompting**
**Use Case:** Analyzing visual health data (e.g., diet logs, medication charts).

**Prompt (with uploaded photo of a meal):**  
*"Is this a good dinner choice for someone with high blood pressure?"*
**MediGuide Response (Multi-modal):**  
"From the image, I see baked salmon, broccoli, and brown rice—excellent choices! They're low in sodium and rich in heart-healthy nutrients. Just make sure the portion size is appropriate."

**Benefit:**  
Combines visual understanding with health knowledge to provide personalized advice.

---

- **Zero-shot**: Fast general knowledge retrieval.
- **Few-shot**: Learns tone and style from prior examples.
